# visual-studio-code

This is a readme

I created a folder called visual-studio-code on github
I then created and commited a readme.md file on git hub
Then done a git clone command in terminal to move this repository (visual-studio-code) into my-projects directory

I am now going to commit these changes to the repository

testing again on git 

do this in submlime
